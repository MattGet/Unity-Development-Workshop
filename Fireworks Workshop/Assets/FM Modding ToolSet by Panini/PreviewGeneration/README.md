#PREFAB TO PNG V2.3.0

- Creates a PNG from a prefab in an instant
- FULLY Customizable angle for taking the PNG photo
- Save Directly to your mod folder (The folder containing the Root Prefab in your project view)
- Automatically Imports the PNG as a Sprite ready for use in game
- Takes you right to the PNG as soon as its created

How to Use the Tool:

1) Drag your prefab into the Scene in your editor (IT WILL NOT WORK IF THE PREFAB IS NOT IN A SCENE)

2) I would recommend adding directional lights to your scene to avoid ugly shadows, there is a premade light prefab for Full coverage of your scene under Assets/AutoGenTextures/PreviewGeneration or add your own directional lights

3) Right Click your Prefab in the scene hierarchy and navigate to PrefabToTexture2D then select your angle for the photo (as seen in the image below) And that's it! your Sprite will be created in mere seconds and ready for use!

- Front: will position the camera in the top right corner of the prefab facing the front side
- Back: will position the camera in the top left corner of the prefab facing the back side
- Current View In Scene: Allows for complete control of the direction of the photo, will use your current view in the scene as the angle to frame the picture
